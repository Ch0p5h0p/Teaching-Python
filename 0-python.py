1.0: Setting up Python

Python is pretty easy to set up, and only requires a few simple steps.

On Windows:
	Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the installer for Windows
	-- OR --
	Open the Windows app store and install Python from there

On Linux:
	Check your package manager for "python3"

On Mac:
	Same as Windows (if your Mac doesn't come with it preinstalled), just download the .dmg instead of the .exe


You're also going to want something called "pip", which is a library/package installer for Python.
I don't remember if it comes with Python or not, so here's how to check:

1. Open the command console
2. type "pip --version", and if that fails, try "pip3 --version".
   If pip3 works, substitute every time I mention pip with pip3.

Note: the above is only for Windows and Mac. If you're on Linux, get pipx and substitute pip with pipx.


Python files always end in the extension ".py". To execute them, run either "python myFile.py" or "python3 myFile.py"

To enter a REPL (basically a terminal/console), just type "python" or "python3"

Also: get an IDE. These are my top recommendations:
1. Visual Studio Code (not Visual Studio)
2. VSCodium (Visual Studio Code without the Microsoft telemety and whatnot)
3. JetBrains PyCharm

That's all for set up!
